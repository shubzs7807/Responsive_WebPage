# Responsive Webpage with Collapsible Menu

This project is a **responsive webpage** that features a fixed navbar, a collapsible left menu, a main content area, a right-side panel, and a footer. The layout is designed to adapt based on screen sizes, making the webpage fully responsive.

### Features:
- **Fixed Navbar**: The navbar remains at the top while scrolling.
- **Collapsible Left Menu**: The left menu can be toggled on smaller screens (below 992px).
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes using Flexbox.
- **Page Scaling**: The page automatically shrinks based on screen width:
  - **90% scale** for screens between 992px and 1600px.
  - **80% scale** for screens between 700px and 767px.
  - **75% scale** for screens between 600px and 700px.
  - **50% scale** for screens smaller than or equal to 600px.

### Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)

### Files:
- `index.html`: The HTML structure of the page.
